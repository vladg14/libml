  SPECIAL NOTE (the beerware clause):
  This software is free software. However, it also falls under the beerware
  special category. That is, if you find this software useful, or use it
  every day, or want to grant us for our modest contribution to the
  free software community, feel free to send us a beer from one of
  your local brewery. Our preference goes to Belgium abbey beers and
  irish stout (Guiness for strength!), but we like to try new stuffs.

(*****************************************
 Installing LibML on your operating system
 *****************************************)


(* LIBRARY COMPILATION *)

-> REQUIRES:
	* the OCaml distribution (`apt-get install ocaml'). Sources available
	  here: http://caml.inria.fr/ocaml/distrib.html
	* the `findlib' library (`apt-get install ocaml-findlib'). Sources
	  available here: http://ocaml-programming.de/programming/findlib.html
	* gcc (`apt-get install gcc'). Used to build the mld daemon.

Then, if you want to compile the LibML library (optimized code and bytecode,
depending on what can be done on your operating system):
olivier@freedom libml > make
olivier@freedom libml > ls -l libml.*


(* WHAT CAN BE MADE WITH THESE SOURCES ? *)

You can get a list of the available make targets by doing the following:
olivier@freedom libml > make help


(* DOCUMENTATION *)

-> Viewing the source code documentation:
You can try to view the different output formats (each command will succeed
only if the corresponding output format was successfully generated during the
previous step). Just use the provided html page: doc/index.html.


(* SUPPORTED ARCHITECTURES / OPERATING SYSTEMS *)

We plan to make our sources compilable on as much architectures as possible. If
you need an architecture to be supported, just send an email to the authors
(see this file's header). An ssh access to a machine running the architecture
you need to be supported would be really helpful.

LibML is mainly developed on Debian GNU/Linux.


We hope you enjoy LibML!
Cheers,
