LibML's developers would like to thank the following people:

* the savannah.org hackers team, because they provide us an online
powerful development and project managemement tool.
* Richard Stallman, for the GNU project.
* the people who work on the OCaml compiler, and to those who
provide us useful tools.
* all the people who give their time everyday for the free software
communauty.
* and last but not least: to our coffee machines. Nothing would be
possible without them.
